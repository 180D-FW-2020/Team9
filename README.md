## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Smartify is an intelligent interactive player that plays the best smacking tunes at the right time in the right place for the users! It allows users to share playlists, and even control a speaker from thousands of miles away via Wi-Fi!

- VLC Media player (requires libvlc.dll) [Download VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)  
*Installation is required on player device (as python-vlc depends on the dll)*
